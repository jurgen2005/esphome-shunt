# esphome-shunt
Developing a State of Charge (SOC) measurement device for precise battery monitoring using the INA219 sensor module and a 50A 75mV 0.0015Î© shunt, which replaces the original resistor on the INA219.

This repository provides detailed instructions on configuring the shunt to accurately measure battery voltage, current, and SOC. The data is displayed on a compact screen and seamlessly integrated with Home Assistant for real-time monitoring.
